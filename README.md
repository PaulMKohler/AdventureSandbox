### AC Game Editor

Sub-windows are known as "Managers", each having a parent asset file.  The New Game Wizard will walk us through creating our own.

Automatically puts manager asset files into a **Game Title**/Managers File.

Note: There is a file in the **Game Title** director that sets all the game manager files to these files should something like an AC re-dwnload set them to the Demo ones.
