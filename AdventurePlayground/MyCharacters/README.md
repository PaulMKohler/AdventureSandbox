#### Custom Character Modeling

Main window is the **Viewport**

Yellow objects are selected. Frame selected will always center selected objects.

Isometric perspective useful to align objects.

Add items with the shift+A command.  Items will be added to where the 3D cursor is, which can be repositioned using the right click.

We can perform actions on the object (S) for scale (G) to grab, after pressing G we can press an Axis to limit movement to that axis. Or Shift+Axis to remove translation in that axis. You can pull out the item transform component from the blender inspector. (R) is for Rotate.

Shift+D can duplicate shapes.
